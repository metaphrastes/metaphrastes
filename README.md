- 👋 @metaphrastes is the online handle of a professional Spanish medical interpreter and hobbyist web developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating sites apps that will be interesting to and useful for people who enjoy languages and linguistics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that support language learners at the intermediate and advanced levels, especially for native English speakers learning a language written in Cyrillic or Arabic script. I'm a big believer in the power of isolating every word in a video or recording, if need be, as that helped me tremendously when I was improving my Spanish to prepare for medical interpreting. Because of that, I'd be very interested in collaborating on a project that includes audio or video resources with high-quality subtitles or transcripts.
