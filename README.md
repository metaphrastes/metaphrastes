- 👋 @metaphrastes is the online handle of Rafael Aponte, a current Spanish medical interpreter and future web developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in web apps that make life easier for people learning a foreign language. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby and general programming at Launch School, an online school for software engineers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that support language learners at the intermediate and advanced levels. Those could include high-quality bilingual dictionaries and other resources, especially for native English speakers learning Arabic or Russian. I'm a big believer in the capacity to isolate every word in a video or recording, if need be, as that helped me tremendously when I was improving my Spanish speaking proficiency to the level needed for interpreting. Because of that, I'd be very interested in collaborating on a project with audio or video resources with high-quality subtitles or transcripts.
